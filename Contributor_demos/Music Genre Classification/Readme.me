README 101 created by the Jeyabalan Ganesh Nadar!

What is it?

	The project is all about the music Genric classification of the most of the spectrogram and access the tensorflow code into the variation of the models of input cell, hidden cell and the output cell and work with variation of the output in the csv file.

Why should I make it?
    
    Load an audio file as a floating point time series.
    Plot the waveform of the loaded file
    Apply Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to Decompose Wave Form to base frequencies

Who should make it?

   This function converts our file into a time-frequency domain representation using short-time Fourier transform 
   ## (essentially this is the change of FFT's over time)
   ## Plot the spectrogram of the STFT representation


Anyone who is working on a programming project, especially if you want others to use it or contribute.
   Unifyaia-team mates

When should I make it?
     28/03/2024, I have made for the demo test for the unify-ai with alll of the classification of Markdown spectrogram with huge projects of models.

Definitely before you show a project to other people or make it public. You might want to get into the habit of making it the first file you create in a new project.
       Ploting the 3D represenation spectrogram of the SFTF 

Where should I put it?
    Ploting the 3D represenation spectrogram of the SFTF in the frequence range of 0-512

In the top level directory of the project. This is where someone who is new to your project will start out. Code hosting services such as GitHub,Bitbucket, and GitLab will also look for your README and display it along with the list of files and directories in your project.

How should I make it?
    I have made with more deep perspective range of the act of it.
